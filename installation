   ii.	buildout-cache  
   iii.	downloads - 
   iv.	Checkouts - GitHub products that will be installed by Mr. bob.  During installation of any instance on this WF site, buildout will look here to see if product exists here.  
   v.	python27 – instance of python shared by any Plone site on this WF. The version installed supports Plone 5.1

b.	If Luke updates the buildout and I want to update site: In the buildout folder, type: “git pull”     TEST
